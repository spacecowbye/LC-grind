# LC-Grind: Where All Tabs Lead to LeetCode  

A meme Chrome extension that forces you to solve LeetCode's Problem of the Day (POTD) before you can browse anything else. Procrastination? Not an option.  

## What is LC-Grind?

## Features  
- Redirects **all** tabs to LeetCode's POTD (even when you "just need to check one thing").  
- No escape until you solve the problem.
